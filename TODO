1. Test on corner cases
2. Remove debug logs
3. Look at the TODOs
4. Fix 0
5. Implement a function that checks whether number is +-inf or +-NaN (for denormal, I think it is okay to just use their normal representation and let them accumulate)
6. Take the idea that the significand is supposed to have first digit 1 for normal and inf/nan and  0 for 0 or denormal, into account, when doing the reduction
7. inf has mantissa 0 and not 111111 dumbass
8. look at the sticky bit stuff sent on group
