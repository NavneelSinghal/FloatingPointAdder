test plan - 

1. random test cases (used 6 million random test cases, and added a builtin verifier in the main code to check correctness)

2. tailored test cases - 
    each test case is of the form:
    (type of operand 1, type of operand 2, type of result, number of normalisations)
    we also test for the rounding direction correctness in subsequent test cases (show that we do not round away from 0 or towards 0 or towards +inf or towards -inf, but use the correct default rounding used by IEEE 754 standards
    also see "corner" cases for overflow (exact overflow, underflow)
    
    type of floating point number - 
        a. normal
        b. denormal
        c. 0
        d. inf
        e. -inf
        f. nan

    so about 21 * 5 test cases

 11000001100001100000000000000000
Here we use a test case of the form a + (-a).

2. denormal
